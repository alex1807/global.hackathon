We are the #cos(2π) team, consisting of Chris and Alex. 


About our team
===========================

We are two high school friends studying Physics and Finance. We discovered our passion for coding three months ago through the one hour of code of code.org. Since then we keep improving our coding skills. Excited by the chance to participate in a hackathon, we want to display the ability to create awesome and maybe a bit unconventional solutions for the themes, which have been selected for the hackathon, with basic programming skills. 


Our skills and what we are going to do!!
=======
- Chris has profound knowledge of Java and Perl.
- Alex has sound knowledge of Javascript

With these skills we want to follow an awesome approach to deal with all the fine print on websites.
